# Discription:  
This program is an example of a Genetic Algorithm for string matching.
The program take a filename were your tagret string is stored and then use the algorithm to evolve 
the population until it matches the tagret string.  When the program is running it will print out the 
best individual in the population with the fitness of that individual.  When the program finds a match
it will print out the individual that matchs and the number of iterations that it took to get there. 

# Dependencies:
python 3

# How to Run the Program:
python3 GeneticAlgroithm.py
